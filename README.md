# timezonesync

**** Documentation word document "Timezone Sync Service.docx" located in the Timezone Sync Service Setup folder ****

•	Originally written in visual studio 2010.
•	The main project can be opened in VS2017 but not the installer project
  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26028746/visual-studio-vdproj-is-incompatible).

•	The installer basically just copies the EXE in place, creates the ~4 registry keys and registers the service.
