# timezonesync


•	Originally written in visual studio 2010.
•	The main project can be opened in VS2017 but not the installer project
  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26028746/visual-studio-vdproj-is-incompatible).

•	The installer basically just copies the EXE in place, creates the ~4 registry keys and registers the service.
